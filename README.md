## Supply Chain
Outlined below is an illustrative depiction of our supply chain infrastructure. Our company contains three production plants and five distribution centers. Our finished products are manufactured within our production plants and transported to our distribution centers, responsible for the distribution among our customers. Every distribution center covers a specific area. Our production plants have a dedicated area to temporarily store our finished products (vendors 1001, 1002, and 1003). Our six external vendors cover the supply of our raw materials.
